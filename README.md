#### Some dependencies to make this slide deck happen

Install the [`moffittdocs`](https://github.com/Moffitt-Health-Informatics/moffittdocs) package, in addition to [`xaringanthemer`](https://github.com/gadenbuie/xaringanthemer). With this pair (and an RStudio restart if a new installation), you can go to `File -> New File -> R Markdown -> From Template` to find the `Moffitt Slides` theme.
